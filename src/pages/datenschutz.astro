  <h2>2. Collection and Processing of Data</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store any personal data unless you provide it to us voluntarily (e.g., by email or via Discord).
    The Minecraft server stores only technical connection data (e.g., IP address, join time) to ensure the operation of the service.

  <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    This website itself uses only essential cookies and a small local consent flag (to remember if you accepted the cookie banner).
    If external services are used (e.g., Formspree for forms, embedded media), they may set their own cookies — see the section below.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Forms (Formspree)</h2>
  <p>
    The application/contact form on this site is processed by <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formspree</a>.
    When you submit the form, the data you enter is transmitted to Formspree's servers. Please check Formspree's privacy policy here:
