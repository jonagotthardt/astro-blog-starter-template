    <p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Your data will be treated confidentially and in accordance with legal data protection regulations.</p>

    <h2>2. Collection and Processing of Data</h2>
    <p>
        We do not store any personal data unless you provide it to us voluntarily (e.g., by email or via Discord).

    <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        This website itself does not use cookies. If external services are used (e.g., embedded videos or tools), 
        they may set their own cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Server Logs</h2>
    <p>
        Our web hosting provider automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, 
        which your browser automatically transmits to us. This includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Operating system used</li>
            <li>Referrer URL</li>
            <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
            <li>Time of the server request</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
        </ul>
        This data cannot be assigned to specific individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You have the right at any time to request free information about your stored personal data, 
        its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, as well as the right to correct, 
        block, or delete this data.
