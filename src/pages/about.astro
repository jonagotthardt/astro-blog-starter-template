		Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Jona Gotthardt</strong> â€“ the owner and founder of <strong>CommunitySMP</strong>.
		What started as a small Minecraft survival world for a few friends has now grown into a
		welcoming place for players from all over the world. My goal is simple: create a server where
		everyone can have fun, build, and explore without paywalls or restrictions.
	</p>

	<p>
		CommunitySMP is a <strong>free Survival Multiplayer server</strong> for both Java and Bedrock
		players. Whether youâ€™re a creative builder, a daring explorer, or someone who just wants to
		relax and hang out with friendly people â€“ thereâ€™s always a spot for you here.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our server runs on version <strong>1.21.7</strong> with full crossplay support. Java players can
		join directly using the IP <code>communitysmp.de</code>, and Bedrock players can join with the
		same IP plus port <code>20274</code>.
	</p>

	<h3>Our Team</h3>
	<p>
		We might be a small team, but weâ€™re passionate about keeping the server fun and safe.
		Currently, our team consists of:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Owner:</strong> Jona Gotthardt</li>
		<li><strong>Admins:</strong> Trusted community members who help with events and player support</li>
		<li><strong>Moderators:</strong> Players who keep the server friendly and enforce the rules</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What makes us different?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>âœ… Completely free â€“ no paid ranks or hidden fees</li>
		<li>âœ… 24/7 uptime so you can play whenever you want</li>
		<li>âœ… Events, challenges, and community projects</li>
		<li>âœ… Friendly, respectful players from all backgrounds</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We believe Minecraft is best when itâ€™s shared with others. Thatâ€™s why CommunitySMP focuses on
		<strong>collaboration over competition</strong> â€“ we want to see your builds, help with your
		adventures, and create amazing worlds together.
	</p>

		Your next adventure starts here. ðŸš€
